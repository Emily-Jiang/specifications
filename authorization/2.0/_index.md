title: "Jakarta Authorization 2.0 (under development)"
date: 2020-mm-dd
summary: "Release for Jakarta EE 9"
---
Jakarta Authorization defines a low-level SPI for authorization modules, which are repositories of permissions
facilitating subject based security by determining whether a given subject has a given permission, and algorithms
to transform security constraints for specific containers (such as Jakarta Servlet or Jakarta Enterprise Beans) into
these permissions.

# The rest of this needs to be filled in like the previous release...
