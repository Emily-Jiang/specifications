date: 2020-11-08
summary: "Release of Jakarta MVC under the jakarta.* namespace"
---

Jakarta MVC defines a standard for creating web applications following the action-based model-view-controller pattern.
The key goal of this release is to switch the namespace for the API from `javax.mvc.*` to `jakarta.mvc.*`. No additional features are included in order to make the transition from Jakarta MVC 1.1 easier.
